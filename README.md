		# Sheriff of Nottingham game, university project

	The program implements a minimalist version of the Sheriff of Nottingham game.
	There are four types of players: 
		- base player
		- greedy player
		- bribed player
		- royal player

	The project is implemented in Java.

	Program testing is done automatically by running the checker.sh script.
	The goal of the poo_checks.xml and checkstyle-7.3-all.jar files is to identify places in the code that may be in non-compliance with google style.
